# (1) When projects are approved, they are approved for a certain period of time (until the time of
# "original completion date"). While projects are active, this "original" completion date is 
# often pushed out (extended), and then there is a "revised" completion date.

# You have been told that project duration at approval is generally about 
# 2 years (24 months). In other words, (purportedly) when projects are approved, the difference 
# between the original project completion date and the the approval date is (supposedly) 
# approximately 24 months. 

# (a) Is this claim true? Explain.
# Has project duration at approval changed over time (consider projects circulated earlier
# and circulated later). Be sure to discuss mean durations, median durations, and the
# interquartile range of durations (using the "quantile" function).

# (b) How does original planned project duration differ from actual duration (if actual duration is 
# measured as the duration between "ApprovalDate" and "RevisedCompletionDate"?)  Once again, use
# means, medians, and interquartile ranges to explain your results. 
# Approximate suggested length: 3-5 sentences

# (2) What % of projects that have ratings were rated 0?

# rounded to the nearest percentage-point.

# (3) Repeat problem 2, but this time exclude all PPTA projects. PPTA projects are more prone to 
# negative ratings, because after a certain point in time only the low-rated PPTA projects required
# ratings.  PPTA stands for "Project Preparatory Technical Assistance" and it is basically a project
# intended to set up a loan (often a very large multi-million-dollar loan). Only PPTAs that fail to 
# "eventuate" to a loan are rated, which is why they are usually rated negatively.

#Answer (3):
#First, prosess the data by excluding the PPTA projects
PPTA <- which(foo2008$Type == "PPTA")
NOPPTA <- foo2008[-PPTA, ]
